# This is the single entry point referenced by the capability-e2e strategy
# (docs/testing/2026-05-26-capability-e2e-strategy.md section 4). It is safe to
# run standalone today; wiring it into release.yml is a one-line add later
# (Wave 3).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/capability-e2e.sh            # Tier F fast gate (default)
#   scripts/capability-e2e.sh --nightly  # also run Tier N (real agents, creds)
#
# Exit status: non-zero if any Tier F capability failed (so it can gate a
# release) or if the test runner itself errored. Tier N failures are reported
# but do not fail the fast gate.
